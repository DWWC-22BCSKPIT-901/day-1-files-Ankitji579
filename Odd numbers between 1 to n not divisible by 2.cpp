/*
Ques 2. Print all odd numbers between 1 and n, inclusive. Odd numbers are
integers that are not divisible by 2. These numbers should be printed in
ascending order, separated by spaces.
This problem is a simple introduction to loops and conditional checks. The
goal is to use a loop to iterate over the numbers and check if they are odd
using the condition i%2â‰ 0.
